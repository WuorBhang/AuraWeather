- **4 Weather Types**: Cloudy, Rain, Sunrise, Shine
- **Deep Learning**: EfficientNetB0 with transfer learning
- **Real-time Processing**: TensorFlow Lite for mobile inference
- **High Accuracy**: Transfer learning on ImageNet with custom weather classification head

### ðŸ“± Mobile App Features
- **Camera Integration**: Capture weather photos instantly
- **Gallery Picker**: Select existing images for analysis
- **Live Classification**: Real-time weather detection with confidence scores
- **Smart Recommendations**: AI-generated suggestions based on weather conditions
- **Professional UI**: Gradient design with mobile-first experience

### ðŸ§  Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Training**: Complete Python pipeline with weather_model_trainer.py
- **Model Architecture**: EfficientNetB0 + custom classification head
- **Optimization**: Automated TensorFlow Lite conversion for mobile deployment
- **Data Handling**: Image preprocessing, augmentation, and normalization

## Quick Start

### 1. Add Your Weather Images
Place your weather training images in the following structure:
```
weather_images/
â”œâ”€â”€ train_dir/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cloudy/     # Your cloudy weather images
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Rain/       # Your rainy weather images  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Sunrise/    # Your sunrise/sunset images
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Shine/      # Your sunny weather images
â””â”€â”€ test_dir/       # Optional test images with same structure
```

### 2. Train the AI Model
```bash
# Check your data structure
python training_demo.py

# Train the weather classification model
python weather_model_trainer.py
```

### 3. Run the Flutter App
```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run
```

## Project Architecture

### Training Pipeline (`weather_model_trainer.py`)
- **Phase 1**: Transfer learning with frozen EfficientNetB0 base
- **Phase 2**: Fine-tuning with unfrozen layers
- **Output**: Optimized weather_model.tflite for mobile deployment
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy metrics, confusion matrix, classification reports

### Flutter Integration (`lib/services/ml_service.dart`)
- **Model Loading**: Automatic TensorFlow Lite model initialization
- **Image Processing**: 224x224 resize and normalization
- **Inference**: Real-time weather classification
- **Recommendations**: Context-aware suggestions for each weather type

### UI Components
- **Home Screen**: Weather capture options and model status
- **Camera Screen**: Live camera integration with capture functionality
- **Results Screen**: Classification results with confidence and recommendations

## Model Performance

### Training Configuration
- **Input Size**: 224x224x3 RGB images
- **Base Model**: EfficientNetB0 (ImageNet pretrained)
- **Classes**: 4 weather conditions
- **Optimization**: TensorFlow Lite with DEFAULT optimizations
- **Mobile Ready**: Optimized for on-device inference

### Expected Accuracy
- **Transfer Learning**: High accuracy through pretrained weights
- **Data Augmentation**: Rotation, zoom, brightness variations
- **Validation**: 20% holdout for model evaluation
- **Performance**: Real-time classification on mobile devices

## Development Features
